# Data-Science-Specialization
Course projects from the Coursera Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins

This repository is a place to keep all of the larger projects that I do for the Coursera Data Science specialization.  Most of these projects are also found elsewhere in my Github account, but it can be difficult to wander through it and find the really good pieces among the many repositorries built around just doing a particular thing.  Sometimes I have also renamed the projects in this file to give them more descriptive filenames then were proscribed by the assignments.  

You can find published versions of the projects at these links:
